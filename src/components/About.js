    <h1>hello, i'm beiatrix</h1>
    <p>I am a software engineer and visual designer who is passionate about the intersection of art and technology. I love to design and build stunning interactive experiences.</p>
    <p>My professional experience consists of 2.5 years as a graphic designer and 2.5 years as a multimedia lab computer consultant. While I have had some formal computer science education (C++ in college and Java in high school), I truly fell in love with coding when I decided to pursue web development on my own. For the past couple years, I spent nights and weekends obsessively self-studying HTML+CSS+JS and designing and building websites. As coding became a natural extension of my creative skill set, I decided to seriously pursue a career change.</p>
    <p>
    I finally took the plunge by attending a 17-week software engineering immersive - The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy - where I learned fullstack Javascript. I am seeking to transition from a designer to a hybrid designer-engineer.</p>
