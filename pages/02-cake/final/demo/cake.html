		<p>What makes a cake, cake?</p>
		<p>Is cake only round? Is it soft and light? Or is it compressed? When
		is a cake cake and not bread? Or a biscuit? Or a muffin? Or a scone?</p>
		<p>These are good questions to keep in mind. Identifying a cake
		can be more complicated than it seems. We will be tracing the history of
		the modern cake as defined previously.</p>

    <li class="first"><h1>CAKE ANCESTORS</h1>
		<img class="img-right" src="images/2.gif" />
	    <section>
		<p>Cake's most obvious ancestor is bread. Bread and cake were
		indistinguishable throughout much of history. Cake's other precursors
		include porridge and pancakes.</p>
		<p>The Ancient Egyptians were the first culture to show evidence of baking
		skills, but the development of cake happened across cultures all around the
		world. The Ancient Romans added eggs and butter to bread dough and sweetened
		it with honey. The earliest English cakes were essentially bread, and were
		called tea-breads.</p>   
		</section>    
    </li>

    <li class="second"><h1>THE FIRST CAKES</h1>
		<img class="img-right" src="images/3.gif" />
	    <section>
		<p>Cake as we know it truly began to emerge in the 17th and 18th
		centuries.</p>
		<p>The emergence of the cake hoop, made of metal or wood, affected the 
		texture of cake by reducing crust formation, and importantly, made them 
		round. The first ovens (which were essentially cupboards in chimney walls) 
		were developed. In 18th century Britain, eggs replaced yeast as a raising 
		agent, making the cakes fluffy. The invention of baking powder, which 
		allowed for soft, light, spongy cakes, marked the final stage in the 
		evolution of cake.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="first"><h1>THE ICING ON THE CAKE</h1>
		<img class="img-right" src="images/4.gif" />
	    <section>
		<p>The very first icing came in the 17th century, in the form of a mixture
		of egg whites and rosewater that was brushed onto a cake still hot from the
		oven, then sprinkled with sugar and returned to the oven to dry. It had a
		texture that looked almost like glass.</p>
		<p>Marzipan, an almond paste that separated the cake from the dry icing,
		was developed in the late 18th century. Around the same time, confectioner's
		sugar or icing sugar emerged, which led to the creation of modern royal
		icing still used today. Ganache (cream and chocolate melted together) and 
		fondant (a creamy paste made of sugar and water) were developed in France, 
		and buttercream was created in Germany in the late 19th century.</p>

    <li class="second"><h1>CAKE CULTURE</h1>
		<img class="img-right" src="images/5.gif" />
    	<section>
		<p>Round cakes have had symbolic and ritual significance across cultures
		and time periods. Generally, they reflected the cyclical nature of life.
		The Chinese celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival by eating mooncake, an ancient
		tradition that continues today. The pagan Russians baked sun cakes called
		blini to honor the springtime. The Ancient Celts rolled cakes down a hill
		during the Beltane Festival on May 1 to celebrate the coming of summer.</p>
		<p>Cakes are still heavily ritualized today, with the blowing of candles on
		birthday cakes, the associating of fruitcake and yule log with Christmas,
		and the cutting of the wedding cake. Cakes symbolize the importance of the
		person or event it is for.</p>

    <li class="first"><h1>CAKE VARIETIES</h1>
		<img class="img-right" src="images/6.gif" />
    	<section>
		<p>Innumerable varieties of cakes have emerged over the ages and around 
		the world! The development of cake mix (first appeared in England in the 
		1840s, and popularized by Betty Crocker in America in the 1940s) have 
		revolutionized home baking and made cakes easier than ever to make. 
		Whether one uses a premade mix or not, the process of cake-baking has 
		been made easier by centuries of innovation.</p>

    </li>

    <li class="second"><h1>21st CENTURY CAKES</h1>
		<img class="img-right" src="images/7.gif" />
    	<section>
		<p>Cakes are manifesting into more forms than ever before. Cupcakes were 
		first popularized in the 1990s by Magnolia Bakery in New York City. 
		Numerous cupcake shops have since opened during the early 2000s. Cake 
		pops, invented by Angie Dudley, rose to popularity between 2009 and 
		2011.</p>
		<p>Cake has become an art form as well. Some cakes, called "imposter 
		cakes," are molded and decorated to look like other foods. Claes 
		Oldenburg's sculptural "floor cake" is an larger-than-life cake 
		model. Cakes are even becoming multimedia art. In 2014, Disney made a 
		wedding cake that involved interactive projection mapping!</p>
