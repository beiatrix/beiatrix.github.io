		<p>Deathless Aphrodite of the spangled mind,<br />
		child of Zeus, who twists lures, I beg you<br />
		do not break with hard pains,<br />
		O lady, my heart<br /></p>

		<p>but come here if ever before<br />
		you caught my voice far off<br />
		and listening left your father's<br />
		golden house and came,<br /></p>

		<p>yoking your car. And fine birds brought you,<br />
		quick sparrows over the black earth<br />
		whipping their wings down the sky<br />
		through midair--<br /></p>

		<p>they arrived. But you, oh blessed one,<br />
		smiled in your deathless face<br />
		and asked what (now again) I have suffered and why<br />
		(now again) I am calling out<br /></p>

		<p>and what I want to happen most of all<br />
		in my crazy heart. Whom should I persuade (now again)<br />
		to lead you back into her love? Who, O<br />
		Sappho, is wronging you?<br /></p>

		<p>For if she flees, soon she will pursue.<br />
		If she refuses gifts, rather will she give them.<br />
		If she does not love, soon she will love<br />
		even unwilling.<br /></p>

		<p>Come to me now: loose me from hard<br />
		care and all my heart longs<br />
		to accomplish, accomplish. You<br />
		be my ally.<br /></p>
